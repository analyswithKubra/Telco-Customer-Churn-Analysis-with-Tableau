## Introduction

This dashboard was developed to analyze customer churn using a comprehensive dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset consisted of nine interconnected tables, covering various aspects of customer demographics, service usage, payment methods, and churn details.

To prepare the data for analysis, I utilized **Tableau Prep** to clean, transform, and integrate the data into a cohesive model. The resulting data model was then imported into **Tableau**, where I designed this interactive dashboard to uncover insights and trends driving customer churn.

Through detailed visualizations, this dashboard explores factors such as churn rates by category, geographical trends, payment methods, age groups, and contract types. The goal is to provide actionable insights that help businesses improve customer retention strategies and address specific churn drivers effectively.

This project demonstrates the power of Tableau as an end-to-end solution for data preparation, modeling, and visualization, enabling clear and actionable insights from complex datasets.
